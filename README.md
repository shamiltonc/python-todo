# Python To-Do

This is a to-do app I wrote in Python. It does the following:
  * Looks for a file called "To-Do.txt" upon starting and loads it.
  * Create and delete tasks in a list.
  * Show your list of tasks.
  * Upload a .txt file of tasks from your Downloads folder.
  * Download your current list of tasks.
  * Save your session.
  * Load your session.
